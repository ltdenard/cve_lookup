A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`.

Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address.

They would be able to remove all restrictions set on themselves this way, or rotate the keys of other keys with higher privileges into keys that they control.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.", "publish_date": "2025-05-19T19:15:52.330", "last_modified_date":

This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 >> 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.

The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY &&\n\t\tphydev->state != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... ->\nphylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't.

But\nshould_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by\nwidening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.\n\nLong Version:\n\n=== History ===\n\nThere were a few things leading up to this.\n\nFirst, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was\nmade lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs\ndue to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull\nmm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive\nand skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are\nagain.\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nThe too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:\n\n\t// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only\n\t// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:\n\tcpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));\n\n\tnext_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen);\n\tchoose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush);\n\tload_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);\n\t// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*\n\t// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.\n\n        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);\n\t// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()\n\t// become true!\n\nshould_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()\nand writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be\nsuppressed.  Whoops.\n\n=== Solution ===\n\nThankfully, the fuzzy \"just about to write CR3\" window is already marked\nwith loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in\nshould_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with\nan IPI.\n\nThis will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small\nand I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance\nimpact.\n\nUpdate the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew\nyet another user.\n\nPeter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe\n'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()\nwrites them.

No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the\u00a0`PyNcclPipe`\u00a0class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the\u00a0`PyNcclCommunicator`\u00a0class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the\u00a0`send_obj`\u00a0and\u00a0`recv_obj`\u00a0methods on the CPU side.\u200b The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network.

In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact.

This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum\u2019s class loader via the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property available on all Java \u201cenum\u201d objects. Accessing the enum\u2019s \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.", "publish_date": "2025-05-28T14:15:34.070", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-28T18:15:27.410", "base_score": 8.8, "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss_version": "3.1"}, "CVE-2025-4134": {"description": "Lack of file validation in do_update_vps in Avast Business Antivirus for Linux 4.5 on Linux allows local user to spoof or tamper with the update file via an unverified file write.", "publish_date": "2025-05-28T14:15:34.260", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-28T15:01:30.720", "base_score": 7.3, "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss_version": "3.1"}, "CVE-2025-5277": {"description": "aws-mcp-server MCP server is vulnerable to command injection.

On the other hand, a search operation that internally produces no results outputs a corresponding message in the response without a redirect. This allows a user to determine whether threads matching title search parameters exist, including draft threads (`visible` with a value of `-2`), soft-deleted threads (`visible` with a value of `-1`), and unapproved threads (`visible` with a value of `0`); in addition to displaying generally visible threads (`visible` with a value of `1`).
