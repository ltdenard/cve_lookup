A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`.

Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.", "publish_date": "2025-05-19T19:15:52.330", "last_modified_date":

This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 >> 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.

The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY &&\n\t\tphydev->state != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... ->\nphylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't.

But\nshould_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by\nwidening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.\n\nLong Version:\n\n=== History ===\n\nThere were a few things leading up to this.\n\nFirst, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was\nmade lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs\ndue to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull\nmm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive\nand skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are\nagain.\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nThe too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:\n\n\t// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only\n\t// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:\n\tcpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));\n\n\tnext_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen);\n\tchoose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush);\n\tload_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);\n\t// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*\n\t// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.\n\n        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);\n\t// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()\n\t// become true!\n\nshould_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()\nand writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be\nsuppressed.  Whoops.\n\n=== Solution ===\n\nThankfully, the fuzzy \"just about to write CR3\" window is already marked\nwith loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in\nshould_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with\nan IPI.\n\nThis will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small\nand I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance\nimpact.\n\nUpdate the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew\nyet another user.\n\nPeter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe\n'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()\nwrites them.

No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the\u00a0`PyNcclPipe`\u00a0class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the\u00a0`PyNcclCommunicator`\u00a0class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the\u00a0`send_obj`\u00a0and\u00a0`recv_obj`\u00a0methods on the CPU side.\u200b The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network.

In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact.

This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum\u2019s class loader via the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property available on all Java \u201cenum\u201d objects. Accessing the enum\u2019s \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.", "publish_date": "2025-05-28T14:15:34.070", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-09T18:56:26.370", "base_score": 8.8, "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss_version": "3.1"}, "CVE-2025-4134": {"description": "Lack of file validation in do_update_vps in Avast Business Antivirus for Linux 4.5 on Linux allows local user to spoof or tamper with the update file via an unverified file write.", "publish_date": "2025-05-28T14:15:34.260", "last_modified_date": "2025-05-28T15:01:30.720", "base_score": 7.3, "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "cvss_version": "3.1"}, "CVE-2025-5277": {"description": "aws-mcp-server MCP server is vulnerable to command injection.

Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API\u2014even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `\"Allow-Linux-Login\"`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API.", "publish_date": "2025-06-05T23:15:21.303", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-06T14:07:28.330", "base_score": 5.4, "vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "cvss_version": "3.1"}, "CVE-2025-5704": {"description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects Real Estate Property Management System 1.0 and classified as critical.

In versions prior to 1.12.2, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash \u2014 especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade.

Prior to version 0.16.6, Wasp authentication has a vulnerability in the OAuth authentication implementation (affecting only Keycloak with a specific config). Wasp currently lowercases OAuth user IDs before storing / fetching them. This behavior violates OAuth and OpenID Connect specifications and can result in user impersonation, account collisions, and privilege escalation. In practice, out of the OAuth providers that Wasp auth supports, only Keycloak is affected. Keycloak uses a lowercase UUID by default, but users can configure it to be case sensitive, making it affected. Google, GitHub, and Discord use numerical IDs, making them not affected. Users should update their Wasp version to `0.16.6` which has a fix for the problematic behavior.

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed.

The bug was previously a hidden failure until a\nrecent x86 percpu change [1] made it access not-present pages.\n\nThe bug will be triggered if the conditions below are met:\n\nA) a device under the driver has some LEDs on\nB) hid_ll_driver->request() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-djreceiver)\n\nIf condition A is met, hidinput_led_worker() is always scheduled *after*\nhid_bpf_destroy_device().\n\nhid_destroy_device\n` hid_bpf_destroy_device\n  ` cleanup_srcu_struct(&hdev->bpf.srcu)\n` hid_remove_device\n  ` ...\n    ` led_classdev_unregister\n      ` led_trigger_set(led_cdev, NULL)\n        ` led_set_brightness(led_cdev, LED_OFF)\n          ` ...\n            ` input_inject_event\n              ` input_event_dispose\n                ` hidinput_input_event\n                  ` schedule_work(&hid->led_work) [hidinput_led_worker]\n\nThis is fine when condition B is not met, where hidinput_led_worker()\ncalls hid_ll_driver->request(). This is the case for most HID drivers,\nwhich implement it or use the generic one from usbhid. The driver itself\nor an underlying driver will then abort processing the request.\n\nOtherwise, hidinput_led_worker() tries hid_hw_output_report() and leads\nto the bug.\n\nhidinput_led_worker\n` hid_hw_output_report\n  ` dispatch_hid_bpf_output_report\n    ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)\n    ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)\n\nThe bug has existed since the introduction [2] of\ndispatch_hid_bpf_output_report().

This is\nbecause hidinput_led_worker() falls back to hid_hw_raw_request() when\nhid_ll_driver->output_report() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-\ndjreceiver).\n\nhidinput_led_worker\n` hid_hw_output_report: -ENOSYS\n` hid_hw_raw_request\n  ` dispatch_hid_bpf_raw_requests\n    ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)\n    ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)\n\nFix the issue by returning early in the two mentioned functions if\nhid_bpf has been marked as destroyed. Though\ndispatch_hid_bpf_device_event() handles input events, and there is no\nevidence that it may be called after the destruction, the same check, as\na safety net, is also added to it to maintain the consistency among all\ndispatch functions.\n\nThe impact of the bug on other architectures is unclear. Even if it acts\nas a hidden failure, this is still dangerous because it corrupts\nwhatever is on the address calculated by SRCU.

This is true for normal DMA API users within the kernel,\nas the iommu domain is attached before the driver is probed and cannot be\nchanged while a driver is attached.\n\nClassic VFIO type1 also prevented changing the iommu domain while VFIO was\nrunning as it does not support changing the \"container\" after starting up.\n\nHowever, iommufd has improved this so that the iommu domain can be changed\nduring VFIO operation.

As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be\nheld while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind\nroutine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts\nfor link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the\ndwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)\n\nGadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though\nusb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a\nwindow in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is\nreleased and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred\nduring that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine\nbefore its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be\nnecessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget\ndriver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be;\ncurrently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check\nwill have to be added later.\n\nSome degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(),\nwhich can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a\nsysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device\nlock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that\nthe device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding,\nthis will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive\nwith any changes to udc->driver.\n\nLastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the\nudc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs\nprotection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and\nunlock calls are added.", "publish_date": "2025-06-18T11:15:21.267", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-18T13:46:52.973", "base_score": null, "vector": null, "cvss_version": null}, "CVE-2022-49944": {"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"usb: typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()\"\n\nThe recent commit 87d0e2f41b8c (\"usb: typec: ucsi: add a common\nfunction ucsi_unregister_connectors()\") introduced a regression that\ncaused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs.

Missing free space info items, sometimes caught with a \"missing free\n   space info for X\" error.\n3. Double-accounted space: ranges that were allocated in the extent tree\n   and also marked as free in the free space tree, ranges that were\n   marked as allocated twice in the extent tree, or ranges that were\n   marked as free twice in the free space tree. If the latter made it\n   onto disk, the next reboot would hit the BUG_ON() in\n   add_new_free_space().\n4. On some hosts with no on-disk corruption or error messages, the\n   in-memory space cache (dumped with drgn) disagreed with the free\n   space tree.\n\nAll of these symptoms have the same underlying cause: a race between\ncaching the free space for a block group and returning free space to the\nin-memory space cache for pinned extents causes us to double-add a free\nrange to the space cache. This race exists when free space is cached\nfrom the free space tree (space_cache=v2) or the extent tree\n(nospace_cache, or space_cache=v1 if the cache needs to be regenerated).\nstruct btrfs_block_group::last_byte_to_unpin and struct\nbtrfs_block_group::progress are supposed to protect against this race,\nbut commit d0c2f4fa555e (\"btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when\nwaiting for a transaction commit\") subtly broke this by allowing\nmultiple transactions to be unpinning extents at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, the race is as follows:\n\n1. An extent is deleted from an uncached block group in transaction A.\n2. btrfs_commit_transaction() is called for transaction A.\n3. btrfs_run_delayed_refs() -> __btrfs_free_extent() runs the delayed\n   ref for the deleted extent.\n4. __btrfs_free_extent() -> do_free_extent_accounting() ->\n   add_to_free_space_tree() adds the deleted extent back to the free\n   space tree.\n5. do_free_extent_accounting() -> btrfs_update_block_group() ->\n   btrfs_cache_block_group() queues up the block group to get cached.\n   block_group->progress is set to block_group->start.\n6. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls\n   switch_commit_roots(). It sets block_group->last_byte_to_unpin to\n   block_group->progress, which is block_group->start because the block\n   group hasn't been cached yet.\n7. The caching thread gets to our block group. Since the commit roots\n   were already switched, load_free_space_tree() sees the deleted extent\n   as free and adds it to the space cache. It finishes caching and sets\n   block_group->progress to U64_MAX.\n8. btrfs_commit_transaction() advances transaction A to\n   TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED.\n9. fsync calls btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B. Since\n   transaction A is already in TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED and the\n   commit is for fsync, it advances.\n10. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B calls\n    switch_commit_roots().

The implications of setting a write-protected PTE\ndirty might not be immediately obvious to everyone.\n\nAnd in fact ever since commit 9ae0f87d009c (\"mm/shmem: unconditionally set\npte dirty in mfill_atomic_install_pte\"), we can use UFFDIO_CONTINUE to map\na shmem page R/O while marking the pte dirty.  This can be used by\nunprivileged user space to modify tmpfs/shmem file content even if the\nuser does not have write permissions to the file, and to bypass memfd\nwrite sealing -- Dirty COW restricted to tmpfs/shmem (CVE-2022-2590).\n\nTo fix such security issues for good, the insight is that we really only\nneed that fancy retry logic (FOLL_COW) for COW mappings that are not\nwritable (!VM_WRITE).  And in a COW mapping, we really only broke COW if\nwe have an exclusive anonymous page mapped.  If we have something else\nmapped, or the mapped anonymous page might be shared (!PageAnonExclusive),\nwe have to trigger a write fault to break COW.  If we don't find an\nexclusive anonymous page when we retry, we have to trigger COW breaking\nonce again because something intervened.\n\nLet's move away from this mandatory-retry + dirty handling and rely on our\nPageAnonExclusive() flag for making a similar decision, to use the same\nCOW logic as in other kernel parts here as well.  In case we stumble over\na PTE in a COW mapping that does not map an exclusive anonymous page, COW\nwas not properly broken and we have to trigger a fake write-fault to break\nCOW.\n\nJust like we do in can_change_pte_writable() added via commit 64fe24a3e05e\n(\"mm/mprotect: try avoiding write faults for exclusive anonymous pages\nwhen changing protection\") and commit 76aefad628aa (\"mm/mprotect: fix\nsoft-dirty check in can_change_pte_writable()\"), take care of softdirty\nand uffd-wp manually.\n\nFor example, a write() via /proc/self/mem to a uffd-wp-protected range has\nto fail instead of silently granting write access and bypassing the\nuserspace fault handler.  Note that FOLL_FORCE is not only used for debug\naccess, but also triggered by applications without debug intentions, for\nexample, when pinning pages via RDMA.\n\nThis fixes CVE-2022-2590.

In this case the argument union\nbpf_attr pointer (as well as the insns and license pointers inside) is a\nkernel address instead of a userspace address (which is the case of a\nusual bpf() syscall). To make the memory copying process in the syscall\nwork in both cases, bpfptr_t was introduced to wrap around the pointer\nand distinguish its origin. Specifically, when copying memory contents\nfrom a bpfptr_t, a copy_from_user() is performed in case of a userspace\naddress and a memcpy() is performed for a kernel address.\n\nThis can lead to problems because the in-kernel pointer is never checked\nfor validity. The problem happens when an eBPF syscall program tries to\ncall bpf_sys_bpf() to load a program but provides a bad insns pointer --\nsay 0xdeadbeef -- in the bpf_attr union. The helper calls __sys_bpf()\nwhich would then call bpf_prog_load() to load the program.\nbpf_prog_load() is responsible for copying the eBPF instructions to the\nnewly allocated memory for the program; it creates a kernel bpfptr_t for\ninsns and invokes copy_from_bpfptr(). Internally, all bpfptr_t\noperations are backed by the corresponding sockptr_t operations, which\nperforms direct memcpy() on kernel pointers for copy_from/strncpy_from\noperations. Therefore, the code is always happy to dereference the bad\npointer to trigger a un-handle-able page fault and in turn an oops.\nHowever, this is not supposed to happen because at that point the eBPF\nprogram is already verified and should not cause a memory error.\n\nSample KASAN trace:\n\n[   25.685056][  T228] ==================================================================\n[   25.685680][  T228] BUG: KASAN: user-memory-access in copy_from_bpfptr+0x21/0x30\n[   25.686210][  T228] Read of size 80 at addr 00000000deadbeef by task poc/228\n[   25.686732][  T228]\n[   25.686893][  T228] CPU: 3 PID: 228 Comm: poc Not tainted 5.19.0-rc7 #7\n[   25.687375][  T228] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS d55cb5a 04/01/2014\n[   25.687991][  T228] Call Trace:\n[   25.688223][  T228]  <TASK>\n[   25.688429][  T228]  dump_stack_lvl+0x73/0x9e\n[   25.688747][  T228]  print_report+0xea/0x200\n[   25.689061][  T228]  ?

And, it causes the\nfollowing warning on a small RAM environment with disabling metadata\nover-commit (in the following patch).\n\n[75721.498492] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[75721.505624] BTRFS: block rsv 1 returned -28\n[75721.512230] WARNING: CPU: 24 PID: 2327559 at fs/btrfs/block-rsv.c:537 btrfs_use_block_rsv+0x560/0x760 [btrfs]\n[75721.581854] CPU: 24 PID: 2327559 Comm: kworker/u64:10 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W         5.18.0-rc2-BTRFS-ZNS+ #109\n[75721.597200] Hardware name: Supermicro Super Server/H12SSL-NT, BIOS 2.0 02/22/2021\n[75721.607310] Workqueue: btrfs-endio-write btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n[75721.616209] RIP: 0010:btrfs_use_block_rsv+0x560/0x760 [btrfs]\n[75721.646649] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000fbdf3e0 EFLAGS: 00010286\n[75721.654126] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000004000 RCX: 0000000000000000\n[75721.663524] RDX: 0000000000000004 RSI: 0000000000000008 RDI: fffff52001f7be6e\n[75721.672921] RBP: ffffc9000fbdf420 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: ffff889f8d1fc6c7\n[75721.682493] R10: ffffed13f1a3f8d8 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff88980a3c0e28\n[75721.692284] R13: ffff889b66590000 R14: ffff88980a3c0e40 R15: ffff88980a3c0e8a\n[75721.701878] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff889f8d000000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[75721.712601] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[75721.720726] CR2: 000055d12e05c018 CR3: 0000800193594000 CR4: 0000000000350ee0\n[75721.730499] Call Trace:\n[75721.735166]  <TASK>\n[75721.739886]  btrfs_alloc_tree_block+0x1e1/0x1100 [btrfs]\n[75721.747545]  ? btrfs_alloc_logged_file_extent+0x550/0x550 [btrfs]\n[75721.756145]  ? btrfs_get_32+0xea/0x2d0 [btrfs]\n[75721.762852]  ? btrfs_get_32+0xea/0x2d0 [btrfs]\n[75721.769520]  ? push_leaf_left+0x420/0x620 [btrfs]\n[75721.776431]  ? memcpy+0x4e/0x60\n[75721.781931]  split_leaf+0x433/0x12d0 [btrfs]\n[75721.788392]  ? btrfs_get_token_32+0x580/0x580 [btrfs]\n[75721.795636]  ? push_for_double_split.isra.0+0x420/0x420 [btrfs]\n[75721.803759]  ? leaf_space_used+0x15d/0x1a0 [btrfs]\n[75721.811156]  btrfs_search_slot+0x1bc3/0x2790 [btrfs]\n[75721.818300]  ? lock_downgrade+0x7c0/0x7c0\n[75721.824411]  ? free_extent_buffer.part.0+0x107/0x200 [btrfs]\n[75721.832456]  ? split_leaf+0x12d0/0x12d0 [btrfs]\n[75721.839149]  ? free_extent_buffer.part.0+0x14f/0x200 [btrfs]\n[75721.846945]  ? free_extent_buffer+0x13/0x20 [btrfs]\n[75721.853960]  ? btrfs_release_path+0x4b/0x190 [btrfs]\n[75721.861429]  btrfs_csum_file_blocks+0x85c/0x1500 [btrfs]\n[75721.869313]  ? rcu_read_lock_sched_held+0x16/0x80\n[75721.876085]  ? lock_release+0x552/0xf80\n[75721.881957]  ? btrfs_del_csums+0x8c0/0x8c0 [btrfs]\n[75721.888886]  ? __kasan_check_write+0x14/0x20\n[75721.895152]  ? do_raw_read_unlock+0x44/0x80\n[75721.901323]  ? _raw_write_lock_irq+0x60/0x80\n[75721.907983]  ? btrfs_global_root+0xb9/0xe0 [btrfs]\n[75721.915166]  ? btrfs_csum_root+0x12b/0x180 [btrfs]\n[75721.921918]  ? btrfs_get_global_root+0x820/0x820 [btrfs]\n[75721.929166]  ? _raw_write_unlock+0x23/0x40\n[75721.935116]  ? unpin_extent_cache+0x1e3/0x390 [btrfs]\n[75721.942041]  btrfs_finish_ordered_io.isra.0+0xa0c/0x1dc0 [btrfs]\n[75721.949906]  ? try_to_wake_up+0x30/0x14a0\n[75721.955700]  ? btrfs_unlink_subvol+0xda0/0xda0 [btrfs]\n[75721.962661]  ? rcu\n---truncated---", "publish_date": "2025-06-18T11:15:38.153", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-18T13:47:40.833", "base_score": null, "vector": null, "cvss_version": null}, "CVE-2022-50091": {"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlocking/csd_lock: Change csdlock_debug from early_param to __setup\n\nThe csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by the\nearly_param() function csdlock_debug().

Reference commit:\ncommit bc09c219b2e6 (\"powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt\")\n\nPatch addresses two changes:\n1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )\n   We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU\n   events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where\n   PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused\n   the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is\n   from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will\n   cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in\n   existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's\n   overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.\n\n2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.\n   Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI\n   pending in Paca.

The sequence\nabove is a corner case which keeps the bus operational but without a\ndriver bound.\n\nWhile trying to solve this kernel oopses, it became clear that the\nexisting SoundWire bus does not deal well with the unbind case.\n\nCommit 528be501b7d4a (\"soundwire: sdw_slave: add probe_complete structure and new fields\")\nadded a 'probed' status variable and a 'probe_complete'\nstruct completion. This status is however not reset on remove and\nlikewise the 'probe complete' is not re-initialized, so the\nbind/unbind/bind test cases would fail. The timeout used before the\n'update_status' callback was also a bad idea in hindsight, there\nshould really be no timing assumption as to if and when a driver is\nbound to a device.\n\nAn initial draft was based on device_lock() and device_unlock() was\ntested. This proved too complicated, with deadlocks created during the\nsuspend-resume sequences, which also use the same device_lock/unlock()\nas the bind/unbind sequences. On a CometLake device, a bad DSDT/BIOS\ncaused spurious resumes and the use of device_lock() caused hangs\nduring suspend. After multiple weeks or testing and painful\nreverse-engineering of deadlocks on different devices, we looked for\nalternatives that did not interfere with the device core.\n\nA bus notifier was used successfully to keep track of DRIVER_BOUND and\nDRIVER_UNBIND events. This solved the bind-unbind-bind case in tests,\nbut it can still be defeated with a theoretical corner case where the\nmemory is freed by a .remove while the callback is in use. The\nnotifier only helps make sure the driver callbacks are valid, but not\nthat the memory allocated in probe remains valid while the callbacks\nare invoked.\n\nThis patch suggests the introduction of a new 'sdw_dev_lock' mutex\nprotecting probe/remove and all driver callbacks. Since this mutex is\n'local' to SoundWire only, it does not interfere with existing locks\nand does not create deadlocks.

That removes any sort of\ntiming dependency and a much better support for the device/driver\nmodel, the driver could be bound before the bus started, or eons after\nthe bus started and the hardware would be properly initialized in all\ncases.\n\nBugLink: https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/is\n---truncated---", "publish_date": "2025-06-18T11:15:44.413", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-18T13:47:40.833", "base_score": null, "vector": null, "cvss_version": null}, "CVE-2022-50145": {"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a DMA channel\n\nWhen we get a DMA channel and try to use it in multiple threads it\nwill cause oops and hanging the system.\n\n% echo 64 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/threads_per_chan\n% echo 10000 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/iterations\n% echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run\n[   89.480664] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual\n               address 00000000000000a0\n[   89.488725] Oops [#1]\n[   89.494708] CPU: 2 PID: 1008 Comm: dma0chan0-copy0 Not tainted\n               5.17.0-rc5\n[   89.509385] epc : vchan_find_desc+0x32/0x46\n[   89.513553]  ra : sf_pdma_tx_status+0xca/0xd6\n\nThis happens because of data race.

Currently\nwait_for_device_probe() from snapshot_open() from misc_open() can sleep\nforever with misc_mtx held if probe_count cannot become 0.\n\nWhen a device is probed by hub_event() work function, probe_count is\nincremented before the probe function starts, and probe_count is\ndecremented after the probe function completed.\n\nThere are three cases that can prevent probe_count from dropping to 0.\n\n  (a) A device being probed stopped responding (i.e. broken/malicious\n      hardware).\n\n  (b) A process emulating a USB device using /dev/raw-gadget interface\n      stopped responding for some reason.\n\n  (c) New device probe requests keeps coming in before existing device\n      probe requests complete.\n\nThe phenomenon syzbot is reporting is (b). A process which is holding\nsystem_transition_mutex and misc_mtx is waiting for probe_count to become\n0 inside wait_for_device_probe(), but the probe function which is called\n from hub_event() work function is waiting for the processes which are\nblocked at mutex_lock(&misc_mtx) to respond via /dev/raw-gadget interface.\n\nThis patch mitigates (b) by deferring wait_for_device_probe() from\nsnapshot_open() to snapshot_write() and snapshot_ioctl(). Please note that\nthe possibility of (b) remains as long as any thread which is emulating a\nUSB device via /dev/raw-gadget interface can be blocked by uninterruptible\nblocking operations (e.g. mutex_lock()).\n\nPlease also note that (a) and (c) are not addressed. Regarding (c), we\nshould change the code to wait for only one device which contains the\nimage for resuming from hibernation. I don't know how to address (a), for\nuse of timeout for wait_for_device_probe() might result in loss of user\ndata in the image.

An integer underflow vulnerability has been identified in the ESP-NOW protocol implementation within the ESP Wi-Fi component of versions 5.4.1, 5.3.3, 5.2.5, and 5.1.6 of the ESP-IDF framework. This issue stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data length in the packet receive function. Under certain conditions, this may lead to out-of-bounds memory access and may allow arbitrary memory write operations. On systems without a memory protection scheme, this behavior could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target device. In versions 5.4.2, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, ESP-NOW has added more comprehensive validation logic on user-supplied data length during packet reception to prevent integer underflow caused by negative value calculations. For ESP-IDF v5.3 and earlier, a workaround can be applied by validating that the `data_len` parameter received in the RX callback (registered via `esp_now_register_recv_cb()`) is a positive value before further processing. For ESP-IDF v5.4 and later, no application-level workaround is available.

In VSCode (and forks), exploitation would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the list of files open in the IDE, get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute code in limited situations where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious prompt. In JetBrains IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files, and a list of syntax errors. Claude released a patch for this issue on June 13th, 2025. Although Claude Code auto-updates when a user launch it and auto-updates the extensions, users should take the following steps, though the exact steps depend on one's integrated development environment (IDE). For VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks, check the extension Claude Code for VSCode. Open the list of Extensions (View->Extensions), look for Claude Code for VSCode among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 1.0.24, and restart the IDE. For JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Android Studio, check the plugin Claude Code [Beta]. Open the Plugins list, look for Claude Code [Beta] among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 0.1.9, and restart the IDE.", "publish_date": "2025-06-24T20:15:26.543", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-26T18:58:14.280", "base_score": 8.8, "vector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X", "cvss_version": "4.0"}, "CVE-2025-52888": {"description": "Allure 2 is the version 2.x branch of Allure Report, a multi-language test reporting tool.

The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input.

A vulnerability present in versions 0.9.10 through 0.9.16 allows a user to authenticate to a Linux host via Himmelblau using an *invalid* Linux Hello PIN, provided the host is offline. While the user gains access to the local system, Single Sign-On (SSO) fails due to the network being down and the inability to issue tokens (due to a failure to unlock the Hello key). The core issue lies in an incorrect assumption within the `acquire_token_by_hello_for_business_key` function: it was expected to return a `TPMFail` error for an invalid Hello key when offline, but instead, a preceding nonce request resulted in a `RequestFailed` error, leading the system to erroneously transition to an offline success state without validating the Hello key unlock. This impacts systems using Himmelblau for authentication when operating in an offline state with Hello PIN authentication enabled. Rocky Linux 8 (and variants) are not affected by this vulnerability.
